# jRWD
jRWD is a lightweight, light-touch framework for implementing responsive web design.

jRWD consists of two small JavaScript functions, totalling 12 lines of code,
and two small support functions. The entire framework contains fewer than
750 characters. jRWD doesn't require any external libraries.

jRWD completely eliminates the use of @media queries in CSS stylesheets.
This has two major advantages: stylesheets become smaller and less complex;
and the behaviour of web pages is more fully controlled by JavaScript, which
accords with the original W3C Web Standards Model.

jRWD is open source software, available under the MIT licence. It is compatible with 
all modern browsers and most mobile devices.

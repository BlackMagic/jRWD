//  event() is a single-line JavaScript function that is called each time a media
//  query event-listener is triggered. event() establishes which media query was
//  involved, then passes control to a user-written JavaScript function to
//  process the event.
//
function event(e) {
  eval('px' + e.media.replace(/\D/g,'') + '(e.matches)')
}
//
//  event() parses a JavaScript object returned to it by a media query.
//  It extracts the event-listener breakpoint number from the object and
//  immediately passes control to the relevant user-written JavaScript
//  function, sending the object's true/false value as an input parameter.
// 
//  if a media query triggered a breakpoint at viewport pixel width 380, 
//  event() will pass control to function px380(e). The input paramater
//  e will be true or false, depending on whether the viewport was 
//  increasing or decreasing in size.
